1. Understand how my Java code should use ports when running in a container
   Configure the API to listen on port 8080 by default and make useSSL optional
   Get calls from outside the container working over HTTP using IP addresses

2. Get logging working to a better level
   Start by turning Spring Boot log level back to the default

3. Get DNS working so that the API is called from outside Kubernetes over api.mycompany.com

4. Get SSL working so that the call into Kubernetes from the local PC is over port 444
   Understand how to make this work in DNS terms

5. Use redisTemplate to cache tokens across the cluster
