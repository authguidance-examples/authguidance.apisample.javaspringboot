1. Call API from tests using newer HTTP client
   Basic code for ApiClient
   HTTP Proxy works and I can view request
   SSL trust added to README
   No async
   Use of Jackson to get the response in a generic way

2. Get wiremock library integrated and first test passing

3. ApiClient to be written properly, in line with Node.js
   API returns regions so that test can assert properly
   Consider use of async and completable futures
   First test behaving properly

4. All tests completed in line with Node.js

5. Better presentation of test output in the logger, perhaps with colour or a tick / cross
   Finalize README
