STAGE 1
-------
1. Test only works first time, since next time there is a new JWK
   So I need to restart the API on every test run

2. All tests completed in line with Node.js

BACKLOG
-------
1. Use HttpClient for user info lookup
   Get rid of Apache dependency

2. Node.js - set options in the ApiClient rather than outside
   Copy file down in test code, rather than in bash script

4. Better presentation of test output in the logger, perhaps with colour or a tick / cross
   Finalize README
