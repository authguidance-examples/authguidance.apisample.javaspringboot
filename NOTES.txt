1. Update to very latest released versions

2. Set logged operationName to authorizer when there is a 401 due to no token

3. API paths for security to put back - as an ant matcher - google preferred syntax

4. Test RequestClassifier - both for OPTIONS and dispatcher stages
   Test carefully for OPTIONS, while turning off JSON logging
   Understand impact of this line:
   - web.ignoring().antMatchers(HttpMethod.OPTIONS, "/api/**");

5. Check codacy warnings

6. Re-get and test, then merge to master

7. Update blog - and point to main algorithm:
   org.springframework.security.oauth2.server.resource.web.BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter has an outline of processing

8. Explain that it is quite hard work to take control over:
   - Make every request go via CustomAuthenticationManager
   - Make all errors go via CustomAuthenticationEntryPoint

9. Re-test built in request scope with JsonReader and GetCompanyTransactions
   See if that problem persists and I should leave my blog comment on 'notorious error' in place
