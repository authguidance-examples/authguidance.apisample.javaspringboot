M1: Get claims passed through to controllers and logic completed
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Understand how to inject stuff created from the SecurityContextHolder
   Inject API claims into the Company Repository and the User Info Controller
   Apply claims authorization to deny access to company 4

2. Set security context properly
   User Id is: 00uc5txme5djp51gG0h7
   Identity name and Principal strings should be equal to this user id
   Instead they are set to com.mycompany.api.basicapi.entities.ApiClaims@5884ead6
   I need to set Granted Authority better

M2: Java polish up and learning
-------------------------------
1. Where does this debug message come from?
   'Using generated security password'

2. I need to try to inject my JSON configuration into ApiSecurityConfiguration
   Also inject SecurityContextHolder into API operations
   These may have request scope, which I don't properly understand

3. Claims Service fires twice for async requests
   I need to control when it runs via security.filter-dispatcher-types=REQUEST, ERROR
   I'd like to do this as part of the fluent configuration in ApiSecurityConfiguration.configure
   Alternatively I may need to create a FilterRegistrationBean

M3: Integrate the certified library
---------------------------------
1. Get calls to OAuth server working, along with Fiddler debugging
     https://bitbucket.org/connect2id/oauth-2.0-sdk-with-openid-connect-extensions
     
     // Introspect is in OAuth library as opposed to OIDC library
