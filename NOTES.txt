0. Do CORS differently
   See if I still need to write CORS response headers on error

1. Check codacy warnings

2. Update blog - and point to main algorithm:
   org.springframework.security.oauth2.server.resource.web.BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter has an outline of processing

3. Explain that it is quite hard work to take control over:
   - Make every request go via CustomAuthenticationManager
   - Make all errors go via CustomAuthenticationEntryPoint

4. Look at .Net Core / NodeJS / Serverless for claims injection
   Make possible improvements
