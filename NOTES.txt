org.springframework.security.oauth2.server.resource.web.BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter has an outline of processing

- AuthenticationEntryPoint - when no token received
- AuthenticationManager - succeed or throw an AuthenticationException derived value
- AccessDeniedHandler - handles the above AuthenticationException

// See this link for problems:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41140669/handle-security-exceptions-in-spring-boot-resource-server

// Handle both errors in one place:
public class AuthExceptionHandler implements AuthenticationEntryPoint, AccessDeniedHandler {


1. Do I still need the filter exception?

2. Can I get rid of RequestClassifier?

3. Update to very latest released versions

4. Is UI loading user info?

5. Blog update once done

6. Set logged operationName to authorizer when there is a 401 due to no token

7. API paths for security to put back - as an ant matcher - google preferred syntax
